              <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
              <p>Hey there! Welcome to FollowUps‚Äôs Refund & Cancellation Policy. We know fine print isn‚Äôt your favorite reading material, so we‚Äôve made this as clear and concise as possible (while still keeping our lawyers happy üòÑ).</p>
              <p>This policy outlines how we handle subscription payments, cancellations, and refund requests. It applies to all services offered by FollowUps, operated by <strong>FollowUps</strong>, through our website and app.</p>
              <p>By purchasing a subscription or using our services, you agree to the terms below. This policy is part of our broader legal agreement, including our <Link href="/terms-and-conditions">Terms & Conditions</Link> and <Link href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link>.</p>

              <h2>2. Free Tier Access</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Always Free. Forever.</strong> You can use our Free Tier at no cost and without entering payment information.</li>
                <li><strong>No Strings Attached.</strong> No refund is necessary because you never paid. Enjoy exploring!</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>3. Paid Plans & Subscription Model</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed-Term Only:</strong> We offer one-time, pre-paid subscription plans (e.g., monthly for Pro, annually for Business).</li>
                <li><strong>No Auto-Renewal:</strong> You pay once, use it, and decide whether to renew. No surprise charges here.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Duration:</strong> Your premium features remain active for the full duration you paid for.</li>
                <li><strong>Downgrade to Free Tier:</strong> After expiry, you‚Äôll revert to our Free Tier with limited access.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>4. Refund Policy Overview</h2>
              <p>We aim to be fair, but also transparent. Our <strong>default stance is no refunds</strong>, with some exceptions.</p>
              <h3>‚úÖ Refunds Will Not Be Issued for:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Changing your mind after purchase.</li>
                <li>Dissatisfaction with features (try the Free Tier first!).</li>
                <li>Forgetting to cancel or assuming auto-renewal.</li>
                <li>Inactivity during the subscription.</li>
                <li>Suspensions due to Terms of Use violations.</li>
                <li>Choosing the wrong plan or duration (unless it‚Äôs our billing error).</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>5. Exceptional Refunds (Case-by-Case)</h2>
              <p>We <em>may</em> consider refunds under these rare circumstances:</p>
              <h3>üîÑ Billing Errors:</h3>
              <p>If you were overcharged or double-charged due to a mistake on our side, we‚Äôll fix it and issue a refund promptly.</p>
              <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Service Outage:</h3>
              <p>If our paid features were <strong>completely down</strong> for <strong>3+ consecutive days</strong>, and it was <strong>our fault</strong> (not due to maintenance or external issues), we‚Äôll consider a pro-rated refund.</p>
              <h3>‚öñÔ∏è Legal Requirements:</h3>
              <p>If laws in your country give you additional refund rights (like the <strong>14-day cooling-off period in the EU</strong>), we‚Äôll honor them. If you <strong>begin using</strong> the service during that window, your refund rights may be waived under applicable law.</p>

              <h2>6. How to Request a Refund</h2>
              <p>Think you&apos;re eligible for a refund? Here&apos;s how to ask:</p>
