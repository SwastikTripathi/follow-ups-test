              <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
              <p>Hey there! Welcome to FollowUps’s Refund & Cancellation Policy. We know fine print isn’t your favorite reading material, so we’ve made this as clear and concise as possible (while still keeping our lawyers happy 😄).</p>
              <p>This policy outlines how we handle subscription payments, cancellations, and refund requests. It applies to all services offered by FollowUps, operated by <strong>FollowUps</strong>, through our website and app.</p>
              <p>By purchasing a subscription or using our services, you agree to the terms below. This policy is part of our broader legal agreement, including our <Link href="/terms-and-conditions">Terms & Conditions</Link> and <Link href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link>.</p>

              <h2>2. Free Tier Access</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Always Free. Forever.</strong> You can use our Free Tier at no cost and without entering payment information.</li>
                <li><strong>No Strings Attached.</strong> No refund is necessary because you never paid. Enjoy exploring!</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>3. Paid Plans & Subscription Model</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed-Term Only:</strong> We offer one-time, pre-paid subscription plans (e.g., monthly for Pro, annually for Business).</li>
                <li><strong>No Auto-Renewal:</strong> You pay once, use it, and decide whether to renew. No surprise charges here.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Duration:</strong> Your premium features remain active for the full duration you paid for.</li>
                <li><strong>Downgrade to Free Tier:</strong> After expiry, you’ll revert to our Free Tier with limited access.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>4. Refund Policy Overview</h2>
              <p>We aim to be fair, but also transparent. Our <strong>default stance is no refunds</strong>, with some exceptions.</p>
              <h3>✅ Refunds Will Not Be Issued for:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Changing your mind after purchase.</li>
                <li>Dissatisfaction with features (try the Free Tier first!).</li>
                <li>Forgetting to cancel or assuming auto-renewal.</li>
                <li>Inactivity during the subscription.</li>
                <li>Suspensions due to Terms of Use violations.</li>
                <li>Choosing the wrong plan or duration (unless it’s our billing error).</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>5. Exceptional Refunds (Case-by-Case)</h2>
              <p>We <em>may</em> consider refunds under these rare circumstances:</p>
              <h3>🔄 Billing Errors:</h3>
              <p>If you were overcharged or double-charged due to a mistake on our side, we’ll fix it and issue a refund promptly.</p>
              <h3>🛠️ Service Outage:</h3>
              <p>If our paid features were <strong>completely down</strong> for <strong>3+ consecutive days</strong>, and it was <strong>our fault</strong> (not due to maintenance or external issues), we’ll consider a pro-rated refund.</p>
              <h3>⚖️ Legal Requirements:</h3>
              <p>If laws in your country give you additional refund rights (like the <strong>14-day cooling-off period in the EU</strong>), we’ll honor them. If you <strong>begin using</strong> the service during that window, your refund rights may be waived under applicable law.</p>

              <h2>6. How to Request a Refund</h2>
              <p>Think you&apos;re eligible for a refund? Here&apos;s how to ask:</p>
              <p><strong>📩 Email us at:</strong> <a href="mailto:followups.contact@gmail.com">followups.contact@gmail.com</a></p>
              <p><strong>Include:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your full name and account email.</li>
                <li>Date of purchase and plan type.</li>
                <li>The reason for the refund (with any evidence—e.g., screenshots or transaction ID).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>⏳ Time limit:</strong> Send your request within <strong>14 days</strong> of the issue or transaction (unless your jurisdiction allows more time).</p>
              <p><strong>🧾 Response Time:</strong> We’ll reply within <strong>7–10 business days</strong>.</p>

              <h2>7. Handling Cancellations</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cancel Anytime:</strong> Since there’s no auto-renewal, you don’t need to cancel. Just let the term expire.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> Want to wipe your account? You can delete it permanently via your Settings page.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Cancellation Data Access:</strong> After cancellation or expiry:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Your data remains accessible for <strong>30 days</strong>.</li>
                    <li>After that, we may archive or delete it in accordance with our <Link href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link> and data retention obligations.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>8. Chargebacks & Disputes</h2>
              <p>We get it—things happen. But please talk to us before initiating a chargeback.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Unfair Chargebacks:</strong> If you issue a chargeback without contacting us first, we may suspend or terminate your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> We reserve the right to reject refund requests suspected of abuse (e.g., using most of the service and then demanding a full refund).</li>
                <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> If you&apos;re unhappy with how your refund was handled:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>India:</strong> Contact our Grievance Officer (below).</li>
                    <li><strong>EU/UK:</strong> You may use local alternative dispute resolution bodies.</li>
